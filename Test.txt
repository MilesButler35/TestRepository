Here are things that you may need to know about how to access git.

I would recommend using the github app to make things a bit easier.

Assuming you have the github desktop app all you have to do is select the TestRepository as the main repository by going up to the top left

Click current repository and change it to test repository by selecting it from the dropdown

Then click pull from repository if you haven't made any changes.
